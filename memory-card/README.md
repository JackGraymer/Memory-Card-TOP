# Memory Card TOP

#### This project goal is to improve the understanding of React concepts so far, aiming to use mainly Hooks or lifecycle methods and state for achieving the game functionality

Memory card is a game were you are presented with different but similar looking cards. The objective of the game is to click each image only once, failing if you click by mistake twice over the same.
The dificulty is that every time a card is clicked, they get reorganized, having to to memorize every time, what cards were already selected.

        <li>Check this <strong><a href='https://heldersrvio.github.io/memory-card-game/'>answer</a></strong>  to understan the game logic</li>
        <li>Create a new project using <code>create-react-app</code>.</li>
        <li>Take a little bit of time to think about how you want to implement your application, the features you want to implement, which components you need, and how to structure your application. Your application should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a “Best Score”, which shows the best score you achieved thus far. You also need a couple of cards that display images and possibly informational text. There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. Be sure to invoke that function when the component mounts.</li>
        <li>Now that you’ve thought about the structure of your application, set up the folder structure and start creating the components. We suggest you use functional components and therefore hooks in this project.</li>
        <li>Style your application so you can show it off!</li>
        <li>As always, push the project to GitHub.</li>
    </ol>
